Design Decision
Why React? - Because I am comfortable using React, and it is commonly used.
Why Node.js/Express? - Due to time limitations, I chose the language I am most comfortable with. Additionally, Node.js/Express is generally easy to work with, making it a good fit for the time constraint. Scaling is not a critical concern.
Why MongoDB? - Because it is Node.js-friendly and free to deploy via MongoDB Atlas.

Also, sorry for the Bad naming convention especiialy in React; I didn't have enough time to refactor.
